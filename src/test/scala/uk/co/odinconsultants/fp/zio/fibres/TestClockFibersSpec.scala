   * Hi, In the zio docs (https://zio.dev/docs/howto/howto_test_effects#testing-clock) there is an example:
   * Isn't it possible for TestClock.adjust(10.seconds) to occur before ZIO.sleep(10.seconds), thus getting stuck
   * forever or is there some kind of magic going on here that I don't understand?
   * Test effects Â· ZIO
   *
   * luis3m11/28/2020
   * @mojo no, ZIO.sleep gets stuck until the clock is manually advanced which is what TestClock.adjust does
   * mojo replied to luis3m11/28/2020
   * But if it adjusts before the sleep?
   * luis3m11/28/2020
   * @mojo I was wrong it does get stuck if you adjust first, anyway I think it's not supposed to adjust first because
   * a fiber is a running computation. It should sleep first always in that particular example
   * luis3m11/28/2020
   * @mojo which ZIO version are you using?
   * mojo11/28/2020
   * 1.0.3
   * luis3m11/28/2020
   * @mojo it's strange, after downgrading to 1.0.0 I'm not able to get it to be stuck.
   * mojo11/28/2020
   * Funny if this is a bug, I still don't understand why the fiber should run first, is this a given in ZIO?
   * aartigao replied to mojo11/28/2020
   * It's definitively possible. Forking afaik means scheduling execution in another Fiber, thus it's possible to hit adjust before sleep
