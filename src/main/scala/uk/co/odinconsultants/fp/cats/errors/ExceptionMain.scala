so a concern about something like the above is Defer only gives you laziness
but it doesn't really talk about how it is lazy
for example, imagine that we had done this:
def foo[F[_]: Applicative: Defer](): F[Unit] = {
  val eff = Defer[F].defer(Applicative[F].pure(println("side effect")))
  eff *> eff
}
nothing weird about that, and it'll work just fine if you call foo[IO]
however, it might not work fine if you call foo with Eval!
(and Eval is a valid member here)
Eval is free to memoize things, and in fact in some constructors, it does exactly that
memoizing would mean that we don't re-run the effect, which is actually pretty important
Another problem shows up if you have errors
def foo[F[_]: Applicative: Defer](): F[Unit] =
  Defer[F].defer(Applicative[F].pure(throw Exception("boom")))
IO will catch that, Eval won't, and both are valid instantiations for F
so Sync is definitely what you want here :-)
basically, there are a lot of subtle cases surrounding effect capture, and Sync/Async are properly constrained such
that implementations are not allowed to behave poorly in those cases
Defer is justâ€¦ stack safety

much better answer :)

  }

  def foo[F[_]: Applicative: Defer](): F[Unit] =
    Defer[F].defer(Applicative[F].pure(throw new Exception("boom")))
